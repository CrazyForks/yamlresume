## YAMLResume Core

The YAMLResume Core is the core of [YAMLResume](https://yamlresume.dev). It is
in charge of the typesetting and layout of the resume.

Most likely you don't need to care about this package if you are not willing to
build your own resume builder app. Check [YAMLResume
CLI](https://yamlresume.dev/docs/cli) for end user cases.
